# School-Experiment-Grapher
This is a program that is suitable for students who need to do analysis on their results in experiments. Suitable for GCSE and A-level (UK)
Features:
1. Allows users to enter their data, which includes but not limited to, their values, their uncertainties and the formula that models their equation (only linear is accepted)
2. Plots a graph with their data which the user can further analyse, graph includes a scatter plot of their points, a line of best fit and error bars.
3. Provides the user with data about their experiment, such as accuracy of the data with respect to the mean of the dataset, gradients and y intercepts which may or may not represent values in their linear formula

# Notes:

Linear formulas are equations that can be represented in the form y = mx+c where m is the slope of the line, the rate at which y increases with respect to x and c is the y intercept which is the value of y when x = 0.
